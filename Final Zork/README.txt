Hi Dr Exton,
First of all, I apologize if my english isn't perfect.
Here is my Zork game which is named Dwarf Adventure.
The goal is to success quests after quests to unlock items and to go to new rooms.

I tried to implement C++ concepts but sometimes, these concepts weren't really useful for the use I did.
I used:
- Namespaces
- Operator overloading
- Copy constructor
- Bit structures
- Pointers
- Inheritance
- Destructors
- Header files
- Arrays and pointers (also map and vector)
- Friendship
- Global variable
- Public, protected and private

I hope that you will enjoy this game.
